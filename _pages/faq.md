# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is your business model?
It's simple. I create an app and if you like it, you buy it. No subscription, no ads, no data collection, no bullshit.

## Will you maintain this app?
What? Of course! It's my daily driver, and I'll add all the nice and cool features if they make sense and fit the app's idea.

## So, ChatGPT?
It's really great and actually helped me learn Swift, but I won't add it to the app. If Apple releases finally a local-only version for Swift, then I will add it as soon as it's available since I already have a lot of nice ideas, but until that point, I won't send your data to some sketchy third party.

## What about other platforms?
Well, I would consider iPadOS and WatchOS versions if I would actually own an iPad or Apple Watch. However, versions for Windows, Web, or Android are not in my plans. It would be quite a lot of work as the code base is heavily tied to the Apple ecosystem. At most, a web service would be interesting, but currently, I don't have an idea how to set one up with full end-to-end encryption and without requiring a subscription model.
