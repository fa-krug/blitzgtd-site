# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is your business model?
It's simple. I create an app, you can try it and if you like it, you buy it. No subscription, no ads, no data collection, no bullshit.

## Will you maintain this app?
What? Of course! It's my daily driver, and I'll add all the nice and cool features if they make sense and fit the app's idea.

## So, ChatGPT?
As it will take some time until we see Apple Intelligence for third-party developers, i added a ChatGPT integration. It is currently very experimental and requires a bit of OpenAI API knowledge.

## What about other platforms?
Well, I would consider a WatchOS version if I would actually own an Apple Watch. However, versions for Windows, Web, or Android are not in my plans. It would be quite a lot of work as the code base is heavily tied to the Apple ecosystem. At most, a web service would be interesting, but currently, I don't have an idea how to set one up with full end-to-end encryption and without requiring a subscription model.
